# NEWS RAIL
1. News Rail is a React.js app in which we can get latest news based on different categories. All the news headlines are gathered from different news sources.
2. Whenever we load the app we got the loading bar at the top which loads according to the app process.
3. The app uses the infinite scroll with which we don't have to use buttons to go back and forth to the pages. Just scroll down and rest of the content in the app will be loaded.
4. The news in the app is based on current events which is gathered from custom API generated by the newsapi website.
5. Whenever, we click on a news item it will take us to the source of that news displaying whole content of th news.
